        <h>The Start of Ms-X</h>
<p class="story-text">
    For a long time I had been thinking about my friendship with women. 
    At any point in my life I have always had more men than women in my social circles. 
    Sometimes, I would tell myself that maybe this resulted from being my mother’s only daughter (I have had 5 brothers). 
    For the times I wasn’t telling myself that, I questioned why this was the case with me. 
<br>
<br>
    I resolved to purposefully be around not just any woman for the sake of it but to look for those that can help foster positive growth. 
    Do trust me when I mention I take energies seriously! 
    Having decided on that my next challenge was my introversion. 
    How do I get these women? 
    At no point had I intended to go out speaking to random people online or offline. 
    Most friendships in my case have stemmed from sharing a common anything. 
    Be it school, workplace, neighborhood and the likes. 
    My social accounts are mainly for scrolling through news feeds and laughing at memes, not forging aquaintances. 
<br>
<br>
    As fate would have it, I did join Power Learn Project for a 16-week course in software development. 
    One of the requirements was the submission of a project at the end of the course. 
    It was at this point that the concept of MindScape-Xchange (Ms-X) was built. 
<br>
<br>
    Working on the Ms-X website was not as hard as getting women willing to learn life together, pooling ideas, experiences, challenges et cetera. 
    I mean, we live in a world where you can have former schoolmates (for example) come to you for network marketing, some of which are pyramid schemes. 
    At some point I thought of giving up on the idea but here we are. 
<br>
<br>
    The few women who would be active in any activities did power up the course. 
    They breathe life into Ms-X and I credit its existence to them too. 
    Most importantly, I thank them for making it possible to carry along with it. 
    There is no exchange of the scape of mind if only one person is involved, right?
<br>
<br>
    My hope is that the Community may grow and grow its members as well. 
    Being there for them when needed whether in the happy or sad times. 
    It is not expected to be a smooth journey of learning life together but a journey that is worth embarking on.
<br>
<br>
Cheers!
